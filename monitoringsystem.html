				<p>Full-stack application with a secure login for GDPR compliance used for storing sensitive information as well as tracking for welfare concerns. This app was created for a security company, specialising in welfare.</p>
                <p>This company will often have contracts with clients such as Brighton & Hove council, to man emergency accommodations and monitor the welfare of the vulnerable residents. From the contracts start to end, this app is used to add a new site when a contract starts, allocate new residents to empty rooms, as well as ensuring the well-being of each and every current resident. </p>

					<h1>Objective</h1>
					<p>The client required a secure login with full-stack capabilities. There’re multiple sections for creating, storing and updating documents with the use of a relational database. All features have an intentional and simplistic UI/UX, giving a responsive and elegant user experience.</p>

					<h1>The project </h1>
				
				<p>I began drafting my models for the database, these included: User, Building, Resident and Update models. With the use of Mongodb’s change stream, I was able to listen for any time a database model was changed. I would then push that information into an array to be used in my nav section, which was partialy rendered with ejs.</p>

				<p>Both building and resident models are relational, when a building is created, a number of rooms is entered via a HTML form, this is then sent to the backend and converted into an array of objects before creation. These array of objects are important as the information when creating a resident is assigned to a specific room number within this array with the use of the push() method. A resident is also created within a building and is assigned the buildings unique object id. With the use of mongooses populate() I am able to dynamically render this information with ejs.

				<p>A tracking system is used to document any time a resident is seen, whether they are in or out and at what time, this is for the welfare of vulnerable residents that live in these emergency accommodations. I created a property on the resident schema for this, creating a new Date() on the click of a button and storing that inside an array, as well as if they are in or out.

				<p>When a resident moves out of the accommodation, his details are moved onto a checkout page along with the checkout date for future reference.</p>

				<h1>Issues</h1>
				<p>My biggest issues were deciding on a database, and which structure to use. The data is relational so a SQL database would have been an easier solution but with Mongodb’s mongoose, I was able to construct my database with an explicit relationship between my Mongodb documents using object-oriented programming.</p>

				<p>This was my first large project alone which made use of a relational database with 4 collections as well as many different routes and functionalities. I will most certainly be using this stack in future projects.</p>
